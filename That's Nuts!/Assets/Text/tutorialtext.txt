Hello little squirrel! You look quite good at running. Try moving those muscular legs of yours by using the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS.
Great! Now try hopping with SPACE.
Those sharp claws you have make you an amazing climber! Jump onto that wall and hold the UP ARROW KEY to climb it. (fences and tree stumps are climbabable)
Look at all that food! Better go eat it.
Oh no! That french fry really slowed you down. I've heard they're pretty bad for you. Better avoid them.
What's that gross fog? Those humans are trying to kill you with their poisonous pollution! Run away!
